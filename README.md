# Short URL
is a URL shortening web service, which provides short aliases for redirection of long URLs.


## Prerequisites
* Install docker [get docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/#step-1-get-docker)
* Before you go with the next steps here are some costom aliases you should add to your command line or use the original commands:

## Installation
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose run api rails db:create`
* `docker-compose run api rails db:migrate`
* `docker-compose run api rspec`
* `docker-compose up`

## Running
* `docker-compose up`
* Visit your frontend app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Time Spent
* I spend 2 hours on creating the backend
* Also I spend 3 hours on creating the frontend side since I'm still getting familiar with react 
* So total hours = 5 hours
